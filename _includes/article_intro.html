        <p>I'm a cloud evangelist and love seeing the light bulbs turn on when teaching others of the possibilities of the cloud.</p>
        <p>I'm passionate about technology's capacity to empower businesses and enhance lives. Throughout my IT career, I've always sought ways of automating to better leverage technology to work for us. I recognize the incredible potential of the cloud to solve all kinds of technical problems, and I feel right at home in Microsoft Azure. I'm excited by the constant change and am driven to master the latest cloud innovations.</p>
        <p>I love chasing the high that comes from learning something new and can usually be found listening to a tech podcast or geeking out about the newest cloud breakthrough.</p>
        <p>I've recently joined CompuNet as a Solutions Architect, focusing on growing our Azure practice and expanding into DevOps and app modernization.</p>
