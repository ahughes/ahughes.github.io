    <p>I help organizations to leverage the cloud. My primary focus at Executech was architecture
    (including pre-sales, proofs of concept, solutions design, creating cloud adoption plans, etc.),
    although I remained a hands-on engineer overseeing cloud implementations and providing escalation
    support to a team of engineers.</p>
    <p>I drove revenue growth by expanding the cloud footprint of both new and existing clients, and
    helped Executech employ automation to develop a scalable managed service offering to supplement
    cloud consulting.</p>
    <p>I continued to be Executech’s principal subject matter expert and trainer for both Azure and
    Microsoft modern workplace solutions.</p>

    <p>As training team lead, I presented/trained at dozens of company-wide meetings and frequently
    provided hands-on instruction in one-on-one and group settings. I led onboarding efforts and taught
    all new consultants / technicians in a recurring “technical bootcamp” program, focusing on Microsoft
    365 and Azure IaaS.</p>
    <p>As a senior consultant (and cloud SME), I was a primary resource for all things Microsoft and Azure
    across Executech. I also took the helm at larger clients with more complex and demanding requirements.</p>

    <p>As a consultant at a managed services provider, I’ve been exposed to a wide array of technologies while
    working with many clients across multiple industries and verticals. This offers an opportunity for
    accelerated learning, but also presents a challenge of balancing competing interests, providing me a
    chance to further develop prioritization and time management skills.</p>

    <p>At SCM Law, I contributed to overall systems administration, including leading a small helpdesk team
    supporting approximately 130 attorneys and staff. I reported to the IT Director and helped maintain
    the (primarily Windows) server infrastructure and expanded my knowledge of Active Directory.</p>
    <p>I sharpened my PowerShell / scripting skills and led several initiatives to automate and streamline
    multiple time-consuming workflows. I was also responsible for training new employees and occasionally
    presenting workshops.</p>
